# urAutomaton
Simple Click Repeater updated to an (still simple) automaton called "urAutomaton"

Still working on some important features.
This application should soon be able to automate most processes an user could ever imagine... 

As for now you can use it as:

- Autoclicker

- Clickrepeater

- Keystroke(a-z)repeater


New features:

- You can save your actionstack in a txt file and load it up whenever you need it again.



Planned features/todo:

- Allow more keystrokes to be registered

- Random delay between actions

- Set different/edit delay between certain actions

- Allow drag and drop to be registered

- Allow user to chose multiple saved profiles to be repeated however they desire

- Beautify the GUI

- Beautify the code
