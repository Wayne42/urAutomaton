Still working on some important features. You can see and edit the source code if you want(.au3 or .txt) or just download the already compiled .exe.
This application should soon be able to automate most processes an user could ever imagine... 

As for now you can use it as:

- Autoclicker

- Clickrepeater

- Keystroke(a-z)repeater


New features:

- You can save your actionstack in a txt file and load it up whenever you need it again.

- New Keys added: SPACE, ENTER, TAB, BACKSPACE, ARROW KEYS 

- Delay between actions is now customizable



Planned features/todo:

- Allow more keystrokes to be registered

- Random delay between actions

- Set different/edit delay between certain actions

- Allow drag and drop to be registered

- Allow user to chose multiple saved profiles to be repeated however they desire

- Beautify the GUI

- Beautify the code
